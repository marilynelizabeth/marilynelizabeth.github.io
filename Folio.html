I decided to use this promotional video for a phone concept called Phoneblocks as my cool internet piece. I chose this video because the concept is quite brilliant and revolutionary, which will hopefully take form sometime within the next few years. The concept is essentially a phone that you will never have to throw out for a new model; instead, you replace individual parts that you wish to upgrade. I find that the idea is amazing but the design of the phone seems a bit dated and possibly a little chunky because of its Lego-styled layout. This creation can help me in relation to my own projects because of the creative invention of it all. It helps spark new ideas in relation to the phone application in class, as well as, projects that I will be working on in my Design It Yourself class.

		<h2>HOW A PONZI SCHEME WORKS</h2>

For this week, I wanted to share the ending credits for the movie ‘The Other Guys.’ I chose this video because it is an amazing motion graphic explaining ‘How a Ponzi Scheme Works’ at the end of a movie that most people probably wouldn’t expect to have such stunning ending credits. The intent is to easily explain a Ponzi scheme to an audience in a short period of time, relying mainly on visuals. This video reminds me of the ‘Trillion Dollar War’ motion graphic, created by VolumeOne because they are both graphically dominant motion graphics that seek to send a strong message in an easily given form. I find this video to be more of a success because it has more interactive pieces without having to constantly rotate the screen that begins to become nauseating. I will definitely apply this in several of my classes over the course of this semester, due to the easily digested information and creative solutions displayed in a visually stimulating format.

		<h2>GREYSCALE GORILLA</h2>

Today I decided to share the blog Greyscalegorilla because it’s an amazing website that features a group who creates tools and tutorials on AE and other programs. They are an active group and resource for training and tools for those who want to delve into animated graphics. I will definitely be using this blog as a resource for my projects because I have already learned so many things from watching a few of their “Intro to AfterEffects” videos. The difference between them and the Lynda tutorials is that, although they do not cover each and every tool and use in the program (because there are so many,) they do show quick tutorials on how to do things that you would probably really want to learn. I would definitely recommend anyone with an interest in motion graphics to take a look at the blog because they also sell a variety of texture and lighting kits to add to your animations!

I was looking through a bunch of animated shape-based graphics through Vimeo and came across this music video that displays a abstracted version of the music in a very cool sequence. When I stumbled upon this, I was very intrigued by the simplistic introduction that slowly plays itself out into something highly complex. My personal thoughts–the video could have been much more successful if it remained as a two-dimensional video. The intro is brilliant and the complication of all the sounds working together to create an abstracted music score are wonderful, but once the video turns into a three-dimensional visual, the beauty of it gets lost in all the effects. I would use this as a learning tool for the future in all of my GD classes because it signifies how something simple can be more than enough. Looking closely, everything was very complex, but only when it looked simple did the video truly shine.

		<h2>CINEMAGRAPHS</h2>

My friend had a project where she needed to embody time without portraying it so I told her she should try to make a GIF, but not an ordinary GIF, a Cinemagraph-styled GIF. This website is devoted to a new-age version of GIFs because of their high-quality, timeless feeling. The image is a high-resolution photograph that has masked-out video components that breathe life into one instant in the image. By doing this, they create a never ending photograph that is living but not quite a video. I would love to use this trick in any of my future projects because they look so elegant and constant. I believe that it would work well for an animated logo or large pictorial components to a website or portfolio.

		<h2>MCDONALD'S</h2>

When I was looking through website designs I came across the McDonald’s website and thought that it was odd how well made it was. It makes sense because of how much money McDonald’s rakes in but it was still a shock to see something from a fast food company done so well. They have everything from a well-organized navigation menu that highlights the menu. Locations, and career opportunities to a meal builder that allows you select menu items and calculate the total calories of the meal. I plan to use this while making my redesigned website because it has all the bells and whistles that my interviewees said they would appreciate having. Overall, I would recommend anyone to take a look at the website and really take the time to appreciate all the effort gone into create this very clean easy-to-use website.

		<h2>TYPOGRAPHY MANIA</h2>

Typography Mania is a weekly post series of collected typography from the web. They showcase tons of interesting typography designs that are very inspiring and help designers see what other designers are doing out in the world. I am most enthralled by the submissions that have video links that allow you to watch the maker create the typography. It’s amazing to see someone hand letter an intricate piece as well as see someone etch their design into a panel of wood. I would like to use these works of art as inspiration to figure out what sorts of designs I want to create to convey particular tones and moods in a piece. I will definitely be using this site in the future and hope to gain some creative inspiration!
